# Unicode Character Inspector

Summary

This project is a small WPF application allowing to inspect the Unicode code points composing a specified text.
It does so by relying on the sibling project [UnicodeInformation](https://github.com/GoldenCrystal/NetUnicodeInfo).

Using the application

Simply launch the application, then type or paste some text in the text box on the top of the window.
The code points will be displayed in the list on the left side. Select one of them to display the associated information in the bottom-right pane.
